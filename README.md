# Huffman-Encoding-Algorithm
Java implementation of AVL Tree with Enhanced Index-Based Access. This project delves into creative techniques for node manipulation within the AVL tree structure. These techniques ensure efficient retrieval by index while maintaining the self-balancing properties of the classic AVL tree (efficient search, insertion, and deletion).
